# Performance Guitar Hero Controller

## Summary
The goal of hacking this Guitar Hero controller was to create a unique way to perform live electronic music during my shows as 'baircave'. In addition to using the controller's built in inputs through a direct USB connection, I installed a two micro controllers--one responsible for controlling the lights and another for parsing input from the ribbon sensor that I installed. By custom molding clear fret buttons I was able to make the controller's lights respond in a spectacular way to my playing.

## Features
* Sound responsive RGB LEDs along the outline of the controller's body
* Matte black painted finish on the body
* Input responsive LEDs along the fretboard
* Playable built in controls with the help of drivers from Colin Munro
* Custom Max 6 software patches that parse all input from micro controller software and map that input to scales and various musical parameters
* In-the-box MIDI output for use with any digital audio workstation
